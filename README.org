* What is this?

This is a script to get the complex refractive index $n = n * ik$ from the ellipsometric parameters $\Delta$ and $\Psi$ I got from a simulation.

Here are the files:
- orgmode: [[file:./calcback.org]]
- PDF: [[file:./calcback.pdf]]
- HTML: [[file:./calcback.html]]
- tangled python: [[file:./calcback.py]]

* List of Todos:

** TODO Write a loop for all wavelengths after it works for one.

** TODO Then take even more wavelengths (rows)
